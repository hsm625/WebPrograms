                    We here at statshelp.com our goal is to help you with statistics.<br />
                    Above you will find links to several different pages that can help<br />
                    with some key formulas in statistics. Please help us as we continue<br />
                    to build this webpage we plan to add more and more helpful equations.<br />
                    Please submit an requests to add any equations you think would be<br />
                    helpful to you to team@statshelp.com

                <p>
                    Normal Probability Distribution is a function that tells the probability<br />
                    that an observation in some context will fall between any two real numbers.

                <h1>Probability Interval</h1>


                <p>
                    In statistics, a confidence interval is a type of interval estimate of<br />
                    a population parameter and is used to indicate the reliability of an estimate.

                <h1>T Distribution</h1>


                <p>
                    T Distibution is a family of continuous probability distributions that arises<br />
                    when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations<br />
                    where the sample size is small and population standard deviation is unknown.
